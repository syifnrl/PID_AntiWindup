# PID Anti - Windup
PID Controller library for STM32 boards with Mbed Frameworks. PID Controller with Integral Anti Windup to overcome oscillations caused by the sum of integrator on error signal. Integral Anti Windup can avoid system from output spikes. This library is compatible with mbed-os 5 and mbed-os 6.
